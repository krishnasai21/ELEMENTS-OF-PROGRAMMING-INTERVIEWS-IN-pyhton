    "A Palindrome string is one which reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g, \"redivider\" . In this question we are going to write a program which determines if the Decimal representation of an integer is a Palindrome string. For example our program has to return true for the inputs 0,1,7,11,121,333, and 21474474121 and flase for the inputs  -1, 12,100, and 2147483647."

The time and space complexity and O(n) where n is the number of digits in the input."
