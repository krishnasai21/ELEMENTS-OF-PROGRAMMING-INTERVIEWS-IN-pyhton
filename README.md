# Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI)
```
Aims to help the engineers like me(B.Tech Mechanical Engnieer) for interviews for positons/ job roles like software development
```
Primary focus of this EPI - Elements of Programming Interviews was
```
Data-structures
Algorithms
System-Design 
Problem-solving skills
```
## Solutions are developed as follows
```
Beginning with a simple brute-force solution.
Then after analyzing the brute-force approach and try to get intuition for why it is inefficient and where someone can improve upon it, possibly by looking at concrete examples, related algorithms etc.
Basing on the insights, developed a more efficient algorithm and describe it in prose.
Applying the program to a concrete input.
Given code for key steps.
Analyzation of time and space complexity.
Outline variants--problems whose formulation or solution is similar to the solved problem
```
