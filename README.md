# Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI)

Aims to help the engineers like me who are getting ready for interviews software development.

## Best Interview preparation
                              The best interview preparation is a combination of hands-on pratice over a reperesentation set of problems with quality test cases and explanations

## Primary focus of this EPI - Elements of Programming Interviews was
```
Data-structures
Algorithms
System-Design 
Problem-solving skills
```
## Solutions are developed as follows

Beginning with a simple brute-force solution.
Then after analyzing the brute-force approach and try to get intuition for why it is inefficient and where someone can improve upon it, possibly by looking at concrete examples, related algorithms etc.
Basing on the insights, developed a more efficient algorithm and describe it in prose.
Applying the program to a concrete input.
Given code for key steps.
Analyzation of time and space complexity.
Outline variants--problems whose formulation or solution is similar to the solved problem
